## **Highlighted Projects**

### **Token-Based Creator Economy Streaming Service**
A streaming service with AI-powered content generation, token rewards, and advanced features.

#### Key Innovations:
- **AI-Powered Content Generation**:
  - Enhanced NLP via GPT models.
  - Mathematical personality modeling: `P = (empathy, creativity, precision)`.
  - Memory optimization: Recency bias function `f(t) = exp(-λt)`.
  - Computational efficiency: Reduced response complexity to `O(log n)`.

- **Token Economics**:
  - Sustainable economy using Cobb-Douglas production: `R = C^α * V^β`.
  - Token emission decay: `E(t) = E₀ × λ^t`.
  - Dynamic token-gated services with scaling.

- **Voice Assistant Integration**:
  - Multi-platform integration (Alexa, Siri, Home Assistant).
  - Reward models for voice interactions.
  - Advanced conversation context awareness.

### **Health Service with RMB/GBT Exchange**
A robust monitoring system with health metrics and global exchange support.

#### Features:
- Health service endpoints for system metrics and dependencies.
- RMB/GBT currency exchange for global transactions.
- Excelsior premium features (predictive scaling, cross-chain bridge, AI health optimization).

| Feature              | Description                     | Token Cost      |
|----------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------|
| Predictive Scaling   | Resource analytics             | 0.5 tokens/day  |
| Redundant Backups    | Enhanced monitoring            | 0.2 tokens/day  |
| Priority Recovery    | Fast system recovery           | 0.8 tokens/day  |

### **Java Debug Commands with Token Integration**
Token-gated debugging capabilities for Java applications.

#### Debugging CLI Usage:
```bash
# Start debugging (consumes tokens)
./scripts/java-debug.sh start [class-or-jar] --token-level creator

# Attach debugger
./scripts/java-debug.sh attach [pid] [user-id]

# Check debug status
./scripts/java-debug.sh status [user-id]
```

| Level    | Min Balance | Capabilities             | Token Cost      |
|----------|-------------|-------------------------|-----------------|
| Consumer | 5           | Basic debugging         | 0.1 tokens/min  |
| Creator  | 20          | Variable Hotswap        | 0.1 tokens/min  |
| Admin    | 50          | Memory & Thread Analysis| 0.1 tokens/min  |
